## Company's description ðŸ“‡
Tinder is an online dating and geosocial networking application. In Tinder, users "swipe right" to like or "swipe left" to dislike other users' profiles, which include their photos, a short bio, and a list of their interests.
Tinder was launched by Sean Rad at a hackathon held at the Hatch Labs incubator in West Hollywood in 2012.

As of 2021, Tinder has recorded more than 65 billion matches worldwide.

## Project ðŸš§
The marketing team needs help on a new project. They are experiencing a decrease in the number of matches, and they are trying to find a way to understand what makes people interested into each other.

They decided to run a speed dating experiment with people who had to give Tinder lots of informations about themselves that could ultimately reflect on ther dating profile on the app.

Tinder then gathered the data from this experiment. Each row in the dataset represents one speed date between two people, and indicates wether each of them secretly agreed to go on a second date with the other person.

## Goals ðŸŽ¯
Use the dataset to understand what makes people interested into each other to go on a second date together:

**You may use descriptive statistics**

**You may use visualisations**

## Helpers ðŸ¦®
To help you achieve this project, here are a few tips that should help youbest destinations on a map

Data Exploration Ideas :

What are the least desirable attributes in a male partner? Does this differ for female partners?

How important do people think attractiveness is in potential mate selection vs. its real impact?

Are shared interests more important than a shared racial background?

Can people accurately predict their own perceived value in the dating market?

In terms of getting a second date, is it better to be someone's first speed date of the night or their last?

##  Deliverable ðŸ“¬
To complete this project, your team should deliver:

A notebook with:

**descriptive statistics**

**visualisations**

**captions and interpretations on how the stats and visualisations are relevant to why people agree to a second date**
