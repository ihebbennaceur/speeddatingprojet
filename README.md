## Company's description 📇
Tinder is an online dating and geosocial networking application. In Tinder, users "swipe right" to like or "swipe left" to dislike other users' profiles, which include their photos, a short bio, and a list of their interests.
Tinder was launched by Sean Rad at a hackathon held at the Hatch Labs incubator in West Hollywood in 2012.

As of 2021, Tinder has recorded more than 65 billion matches worldwide.

## Project 🚧
The marketing team needs help on a new project. They are experiencing a decrease in the number of matches, and they are trying to find a way to understand what makes people interested into each other.

They decided to run a speed dating experiment with people who had to give Tinder lots of informations about themselves that could ultimately reflect on ther dating profile on the app.

Tinder then gathered the data from this experiment. Each row in the dataset represents one speed date between two people, and indicates wether each of them secretly agreed to go on a second date with the other person.

## Goals 🎯
Use the dataset to understand what makes people interested into each other to go on a second date together:

**You may use descriptive statistics**

**You may use visualisations**

##  Deliverable 📬
To complete this project, your team should deliver:

A notebook with:

**descriptive statistics**

**visualisations**

**captions and interpretations on how the stats and visualisations are relevant to why people agree to a second date**
